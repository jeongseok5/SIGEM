# SIGEM: A Simple yet Effective Similarity based Graph Embedding Method (Best Research Paper Honorable Mention at KDD'25)

This repository provides the reference implementation of SIGEM and LINOW (linear matrix form, LINOW-sn, LINOW-bn/MP, and LINOW-bn/TF). 

SIGEM is a self-supervised and contrastive-free embedding method that provides a single latent vector for each node in a graph. SIGEM is simply implemented by a single-layer neural network with a listwise learning-to-rank loss function:

(1)  SIGEM employs LINOW, as a link-based similarity measure, to compute similarity scores of nodes batch-wise.

(2) For each nodes $u$ in the batch, it then ranks the nodes based on their LINOW scores w.r.t. $u$ in descending order and picks the top-*t* ones. 

(3) After completing the ranking process for all nodes in the graph, SIGEM tries to preserve the original ranks of the top-*t* similar nodes to any node $u$, within their corresponding latent vectors in the embedding space.

## Installation and Usage
In order to run SIGEM, the following packages are required:
```
Python       = 3.12
tensorflow   = 2.18.0
numpy        = 1.26.4
scipy        = 1.13.1
scikit-learn = 1.5.2
tqdm         = 4.66.6
```
SIGEM can be run directly from the command line or migrated to your favorite IDE.
## Graph Format
1) A graph must be represented as a text file under the **edge list format** in which, each line corresponds to an edge in the graph, tab is used as the separator of the two nodes, and the node index is started from 0.
2) A single original link in an **undirected graph and its train/test splitted graphs** must be represented via two links in both directions.

## Running SIGEM
SIGEM has the following parameters: 
```
--graph: Input graph; default is ''

--dataset_name: Dataset name; default is None

--result_dir: Destination to save the embedding result, default is "output/" in the root directory

--dim: The embedding dimension, default is 128

--itr: Number of Iterations to compute LINOW, default is 5

--damping_factor: Damping factor for similarity computation, default is 0.2

--scaling_factor: Scaling factor to select top nodes (default is None); set it as 10 for link prediction and node classification tasks, and as 2 for the graph reconstruction task

--gpu: The flag indicating to run SIGEM on GPU, default is True

--bch_cpu: Batch size for computation on CPU; default is 128. It is ignored if --gpu=True

--bch_gpu: Batch size for computation on GPU; default is 128. It is ignored if --gpu=False

--prl_num: Number of parallel computation on CPU; default is 8. It is ignored if --gpu=True

--epc: Number of Epochs for training, default is 100

--lr: Learning rate (default is None); set it as 0.0030 for small graphs and as 0.0012 for very large graphs

--early_stop: Flag indicating to stop the training process if the loss stops improving, default is True

--wait_thr: Number of epochs with no loss improvement after which the training will be stopped, default is 10

--read_topK_nodes: Flag to read top nodes from a binary file, they will be selected by computing similarity otherwise; default is False

--topK_file: Path to the saved top nodes

--write_topK_nodes: Flag to write top nodes into a binary file for later usage; default is False

--topK_save_path: Path to write the top nodes into a binary file
```
### NOTE:
**It is highly recommended** to set the values of (1) "--itr" and "--damping_factor" to 5 and 0.2, respectively, for all tasks, (2) "--scaling_factor" to 10, 10, and 2 for link prediction, node classification, and graph reconstruction tasks, respectively, (3) "--bch_cpu", "--bch_gpu", and "--lr" parameters to the ones explained in Section 5.3.1 of the paper.

**We optimized the implementation of LINOW-bn/TF**, reducing its execution time by approximately 15% with all datasets, compared to the values reported in Table 4 of the paper.

### Sample:
1) Link Prediction Task

```
python SIGEM.py --graph data/Cora_train_70.txt --dataset_name Cora_train_70 --scaling_factor 10 --lr 0.0030

python SIGEM.py --graph data/Cora_train_70.txt --dataset_name Cora_train_70 --scaling_factor 10 --lr 0.0030 --write_topK_nodes True --topK_save_path output/ ## saving top nodes in a file before training

python SIGEM.py --graph data/Cora_train_70.txt --dataset_name Cora_train_70 --scaling_factor 10 --lr 0.0030 --read_topK_nodes True --topK_file output/Cora_train_70_SIGEM_IT_5_C_2_listMLE_topK_Scl10 ## loading top nodes from a file for training
```

2) Node Classification Task

```
python SIGEM.py --graph data/Cora_directed_graph.txt --dataset_name Cora --scaling_factor 10 --lr 0.0030

```

3) Graph Reconstruction Task

```

```
